							<div id="panel">
								<p>The future of education is changing, studies from traditional education venues such as the University of Virginia, consultants such as Korn Ferry, think tanks such as the American Action Forum and industry venues such as Linked-in all acknowledge a skills gap in technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) that will continue to grow to a projected deficit of 4.3 million workers by the end of this decade. To place a sharper point on the problem, the 4.3 million worker deficit is 59 times the current workforce for the TMT giant, Alphabet. The result is that the projected loss to these three industries is projected to be $450 billion over the course of this decade. Moreover, the skills gap falls hardest on what traditionally has been viewed as the blue-collar worker who is expected to be supplanted by automation.</p>

								<p>At the same time, the concept of “higher education” is evolving from the prototypical four-year liberal arts college and university to a model that is deeply rooted in the society in which it is a part. That “society” is knowledge-based encompassing the social, economic, and global interchange of information to the extent that “higher education” is more akin to an education market of everything from 5-star to fast food restaurants. This increasing differentiation of learning on the part of the student and the ultimate customer, their employer, in increasingly evident in that the student, almost half of which employ the Community College structure during their education experience, tailor their education in a more focused manner than the traditional liberal arts degree. Doctor David Staley of Ohio State University, in a study conducted in 2011, discussed this trend and the impact of the Community College, its transformation of the education curriculum and its faculty to successfully fill the role of not only justifying its own existence but successfully transitioning these “blue-collar” worker and students into “middle-skill” jobs in this global workplace environment.</p>

								<p>This has been my role from the day I was first employed by CCAC. My first task was to energize a start-up program and provide the experience of this global workplace to students who cannot afford the expense of a four-year institution.</p>

								<ul>
									<li>My first step was to outfit a computer laboratory and not only make it attractive to students but also introduce it to the business and educational community in the area.</li>
									<li>I followed that by investing the time in developing a “Geek Culture Club” that served as a social outlet for students interested in the field.  It enabled them to meet me, the program and realize that there were others with similar interests. It enabled a diverse group of students to change their perspective on the possibilities for them at CCAC. Their genders, learning ability, self-esteem issues, physical or mental limitations were put aside and they saw that their potential was in their hands within the “invisibility” of the global network if they would only apply themselves.</li>
									<li>I continue to make a name for not only myself but for the college with local companies and stakeholders through meetings with those groups, participation in community events and my continued dedication to keeping up on the latest and greatest multimedia can offer.</li>
									<li>I am constantly expanding the program offerings and have developed 18 offerings determining how these courses can best be brought to our students to not only fulfill current requirements for a Certificate or an Associate Degree but also how either of these can address the future of this discipline.</li>
									<li>The result of which is that my department continues to grow in enrollment, offerings and is in the process of expanding into Computer Information Technology and Data Analysis as well as Multi-Media Computing.</li>
									<li>I continue to add to my personal repertoire of programming languages to meet the need of the curriculum and the students.</li>
									<li>As someone who fell into the “middle-skills” category as a student I am aware of the need for our students to be nourished and grow.</li>
									<li>As Doctor Staley discussed, the “traditional” student is changing, and the pressure is on the institution to adapt to meet the need.</li>
									<li>Even if granted tenure I have my future planned for CCAC. My goal is at some point to serve as the CIT coordinator and continue to serve the college as a member of the college council.</li>
									<li>I look to not only continue to build Multimedia, but also integrate CIT and DAT with MMC to create as fully featured a program as possible.</li>
									<li>In discussions with other faculty members, I see the benefit of collaborating with other disciplines to create more cross-disciplinary degrees and certification options for our students. Being able to continue to offer these opportunities to students is something I consider to be extremely rewarding to the student and the core of the community college experience.</li>
									<li>I believe my department is fulfilling the mission of the College and I truly feel this is where I am meant to be, providing value to our students and the community in which they live.</li>
									<li>The most important of all the reasons to consider me for tenure is my dedication to the mission of the college.</li>

							<h2 id="flip2">Teaching Philosophy</h2>
							<div id="panel2">
								<p>My goal as an educator is to inspire students to realize the value of a theoretical understanding of the subject and apply that understanding to real world situations. I strive to be a teacher who conveys my excitement about the many forms of communication studies and their application to real world development, research, and forward thinking. I demonstrate patience and a willingness to help students both in and outside of the classroom, not only as a teacher but also a life mentor providing ideas and suggestions for their futures within the discipline. The students are challenged in my classroom but also guided as I encourage their success at combining theory and development.</p>

								<p>Whether the subject is theoretical or practical, I strive to excite students and emphasize not only how the topic will affect them in the workforce, but also how they will apply it in their daily lives. I believe in a classroom in which students are engaged, and thoughts can be shared safely and positively to energize students to try new ideas and make mistakes safely. Be it a number two pencil or a sophisticated software program, the goal is always to enable the student to think about their surroundings in a new light, and to critically examine these surroundings while encouraging questions that will empower them to gain the self-confidence in that they are as equally capable of the level of professionalism they observe in others.</p>

								<p>My students come from many different areas of the world, cultures and walks of life. Through my teaching, I hope to assist them to overcome any barriers, real or perceived, and convey the excitement I have so they may carry my enthusiasm for the subject through their careers. My goal is to have them learn skills and concepts that enable them to not only find employment in the field but to love being employed in the field. Conversely, I deem it equally important to engender a sense of self-worth so that they do not settle and are alert to those situations wherein they are being treated unfairly in the workforce.</p>

								<p>When my teaching is successful, these are the ideals my students take with them upon completing my course as well as the production skills for the subject matter. I achieve these goals through a high energy approach to the subject and through the combination of theory and practice. My approach conveys to the student that the design and development of projects through communication theories is not just a ‘plug and play’ methodology. Additionally, through the process of getting to know my students, I can monitor and help those who need more assistance.  I encourage thoughts and discussions from all students, while encouraging students who are advanced to share their processes thereby demonstrating that my way is not the only way to achieve excellence.</p>

								<p>To encourage students to combine thought processes, philosophy, and production tools, I provide follow-along examples that engender an active learning environment in which students participate. Students are required to create their own products through classroom assignments to demonstrate their grasp of the approach we demonstrate in class and reflect upon what they made. Upon completion of the classroom assignments, the students develop their own products, practicing the methodology and theoretical frameworks we discuss. </p>

								<p>My overall approach of combining these three aspects is a crucial part of becoming a developer, consultant, or manager. Through practice and demonstration, I combine the three concepts into a workflow that is utilized in any form of communication, media development and design.</p>
