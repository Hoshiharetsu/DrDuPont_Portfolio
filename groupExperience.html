						<p>When it comes to the SOSO evaluations from students, I take these very seriously. I am also very hard on myself, striving for at least 4.5 or above, making sure to give students one hundred percent and the most robust learning experience I can. Despite often carrying a teaching load anywhere between six to eight classes due to situations arising that needed me to step in, every class I teach I focus on each individual student.</p>

						<p>My proudest moment of change regarding the SOSOs was I would often get low ratings for turn around time in grading. For background, grading multimedia video games and graphic projects take hours, not only with just downloading and re-setting up the project in the correct programs so that I can view them, but also providing clear feedback to students that although they may obtain a perfect score and demonstrate the required abilities, the project needs more to be ready to be utilized in their portfolio. With that, in the Spring 2021 semester during one of my classes my students commented on how much faster I was turning around their grades and how much they appreciated it. This was something I struggled with for years and I was finally able to find a middle ground of providing in-depth feedback on projects, but not on learning activities and practices. Furthermore, I have also embraced many of the automated capabilities of Blackboard, such as tests for learning activities focused on vocabulary and less developmental projects, to help with the amount of grading.</p>

						<p>Finally regarding SOSOs, the area I am currently working on to better myself in is asynchronous courses. This includes figuring out how to make the courses more engaging and also providing a humanizing element to the course that the students know there is a faculty member behind the monitor, and they are not alone in taking this course. Now that I think I have a handle on face-to-face and zoom courses, this is my next area to improve with my SOSO feedback.</p>

						<p>Regarding the reviews I have received over the years from colleagues and my deans, observations have been overwhelmingly positive. If anything, one of the biggest criticisms I have received is to slow down, many using the phrase, “This is a marathon, not a race”. I do take this to heart and have continued to work on my work/life balance, but multimedia evolves so quickly, if I slow down, I’m missing information that needs to be integrated into the courses to keep students current. Overall, I appreciate all the feedback my colleagues have provided me, even those outside of my discipline, which is a tremendous help to get feedback from those who are not familiar with what I do, and I am going to continue to give 100% to the students, my course development, and the college.</p>
